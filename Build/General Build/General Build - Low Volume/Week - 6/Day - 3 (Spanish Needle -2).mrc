0	Welcome to Spanish Needle -2	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
0	We'll be performing five 8-minute sets of microbursts today	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
0	Each set consists of 15-second bursts at 150% FTP...	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
0	followed immediately by 15 seconds of rest	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
0	You'll have about 5 minutes of recovery between sets	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
120	Try to hold your cadence between 85-95rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
240	If you can do it with control...	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
240	spin slightly more quickly for a couple minutes	5	0	0	72	16777215	6
360	We'll continue warming with 3 clearing bursts in about a minute	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
360	These are quick, 12-second efforts with short recoveries in between	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
360	Use a high cadence & try to keep it high during the recoveries	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
360	We recommend 100rpm or higher but it depends on your level of control	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
360	No bouncing in the saddle & stay seated as much as possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
360	Quick spin, 100+rpm	5	0	0	72	16777215	50
504	As the warm-up bursts demonstrated...	8	0	0	72	16777215	6
504	this workout is all about alternating brief periods of high intensity...	8	0	0	72	16777215	16
504	with equally brief periods of rest	5	0	0	72	16777215	26
504	This means that you will be able to accumulate a lot of time...	8	0	0	72	16777215	36
504	at very high percentages of your FTP	5	0	0	72	16777215	46
504	This also means that as the set progresses...	8	0	0	72	16777215	56
504	your aerobic capacity (ability to utilize oxygen) will be taxed...	8	0	0	72	16777215	66
504	due to the high O2 uptake needed to sustain such high watts over & over	8	0	0	72	16777215	76
504	Additionally, microbursts will improve your anaerobic (sugar-fueled) power...	8	0	0	72	16777215	86
504	as well as your neuromuscular efficiency (how well your brain talks to your muscles)...	8	0	0	72	16777215	96
504	due to the very rapid recruitment of muscle fibers...	8	0	0	72	16777215	106
504	needed to achieve the prescribed wattage as the intensity shoots up	8	0	0	72	16777215	116
504	Do your best to maintain a steady & high cadence during each set	8	0	0	72	16777215	126
504	100rpm is a good goal to shoot for, higher if you can control it...	8	0	0	72	16777215	136
504	but try to maintain at least 90rpm as fatigue sets in	8	0	0	72	16777215	146
504	The first set of bursts steps up from 130-150% of FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	156
504	This is to aid in the continuation of your warm up...	8	0	0	72	16777215	166
504	as well as provide you with alternative wattage levels	8	0	0	72	16777215	176
504	Try to find the effort level you can repeat without bailing	8	0	0	72	16777215	186
504	10 seconds, get ready...	5	0	0	72	16777215	206
720	Here we go! Quick legs	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
735	Turn off the power but keep the leg speed	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
855	Good, up to 140% FTP, see if you can complete all 5 repeats	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1005	If you're hanging in there, let's try the full 150% FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1185	How do you feel after that first set?	5	0	0	72	16777215	5
1185	Do you feel like 150% FTP is realistic to hold for subsequent sets?	8	0	0	72	16777215	15
1185	If need be, drop the watts to 140 or even 130%	8	0	0	72	16777215	25
1185	Being able to hold your power & cadence for the vast majority of each set...	8	0	0	72	16777215	35
1185	...is preferable to completing partial sets at the full 150% FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	45
1185	So be clear, the goal is to keep your leg speed & power...	8	0	0	72	16777215	55
1185	for as many microbursts as possible, backpedaling as seldom as possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	65
1185	Next set coming up in about 30 seconds	8	0	0	72	16777215	285
1185	Work your spin up to 100rpm or even a little higher...	8	0	0	72	16777215	295
1185	Probably no more than 120bpm though	8	0	0	72	16777215	305
1500	Lots of leg speed for 16 total repeats!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1605	First 4 behind you, are you holding your leg speed high?	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1725	4 more repeats in the can, well done - keep your cadence up	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1845	Hang in there, final 4 repeats just ahead!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1965	First set - Done!	5	0	0	72	16777215	5
1965	It's acceptable to backpedal for a couple of seconds between sets if necessary...	8	0	0	72	16777215	15
1965	but it's important that you get back on top of your cadence...	8	0	0	72	16777215	25
1965	well BEFORE the next interval starts	8	0	0	72	16777215	35
1965	Rests are only 15 seconds, so any backpedaling during this time...	8	0	0	72	16777215	45
1965	needs to be very brief, maybe 5 seconds	8	0	0	72	16777215	55
1965	Then, if you have to backpedal through 3 or more 150% microbursts...	8	0	0	72	16777215	65
1965	consider knocking the intensity of the workout down 5-10% at a time	8	0	0	72	16777215	75
1965	Once again, it's more beneficial to do the bursts at a slightly lower intensity...	8	0	0	72	16777215	85
1965	and complete more or even ALL the intervals...	8	0	0	72	16777215	95
1965	than to only complete some of them at 150% FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	105
1965	You'll still be accumulating a significant amount of time way above FTP...	8	0	0	72	16777215	115
1965	even if you do the bursts at 140 or even 130% FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	125
1965	Enjoy another 3 minutes of rest for now though while you mull this over	8	0	0	72	16777215	135
1965	3rd set in about 30 seconds, start to work up to 100+rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	285
1965	Quick legs & try to draw full, deep breaths the whole time	8	0	0	72	16777215	295
2280	Wind it up, get your power as fast as possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2385	Good, first 4 behind you - breathe fully	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2505	Halfway through the set! Keep it quick	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2625	Excellent, final 4 just ahead - stay focused	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2655	3 more bursts. Hang in there!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2745	Great job! You've earned a little over 5 minutes of rest	8	0	0	72	16777215	5
2745	If done correctly, microbursts will put a rider in a very uncomfortable place	8	0	0	72	16777215	15
2745	But if you can learn to embrace the discomfort...	8	0	0	72	16777215	25
2745	and compartmentalize the pain in the back of your mind...	8	0	0	72	16777215	35
2745	you'll be surprised by how much abuse your body can handle ;-)	8	0	0	72	16777215	45
2745	Concentrate on something other than the clock, your pain or the number of repeats...	8	0	0	72	16777215	55
2745	like your pedalstroke, breathing, body position, or leg speed	8	0	0	72	16777215	65
2745	Anything that takes your mind off how hard you're working...	8	0	0	72	16777215	75
2745	that might increase your efficiency is fair game as a useful distraction	8	0	0	72	16777215	85
2745	Start getting ready for the next set, quick, controlled legs	8	0	0	72	16777215	295
2745	The quicker you spin the less you'll cook your muscles	8	0	0	72	16777215	305
3060	Start out relaxed then stay that way	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3165	Four down, use your belly to breathe fully	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3285	Halfway through this set, try to relax your upper body	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3315	Had to skip any intervals yet?	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3315	If not, try to keep it that way!	5	0	0	72	16777215	7
3405	Final 4 are up next, try to hang in there for all of them!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3525	Deep breaths! Keep your legs turning & ease waaaaay up	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3525	Final set right around the corner	5	0	0	72	16777215	255
3525	If you've been able to hold the full 150% FTP thus far...	8	0	0	72	16777215	265
3525	then you've just locked yourself in for the rest of the workout	8	0	0	72	16777215	275
3525	If you've dropped watts a bit though, no worries!	8	0	0	72	16777215	285
3525	Do your best to keep hammering out the bursts for one final set	8	0	0	72	16777215	295
3525	Get ready...	3	0	0	72	16777215	305
3840	Final set underway!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3945	A quarter of the work is already behind you!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
4065	Halfway point, take these last repeats ONE at a time	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4125	Be tough! And just focus on the next burst, nothing more	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4215	Final 3 bursts, one at a time!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
4245	Try to keep spinning quickly, almost there!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
4275	Final interval of the day! Make it pretty	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
4290	Calm upper body, make it look easy	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
4305	Excellent job! That was a tough, tough workout	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4305	It was also a very muscularly taxing one, lots of tissue damage...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
4305	that needs to be remedied with proper recovery nutrition...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
4305	and very soon so start planning it now	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
4305	Once again, nicely done! We'll see you next time	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
