[COURSE TEXT]
0	Joe Devel +3 is all about high but repeatable efforts	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
0	At first glance, this one looks like a purely Anaerobic interval workout...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
0	and you'll certainly be spending a lot of time in the Anaerobic zone	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
0	But don't think your aerobic system won't be taxed as well	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
0	The short recoveries don't allow your respiration to drop very much...	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
0	so each subsequent interval will take less time to push you closer...	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
0	to your aerobic capacity (VO2max)	5	0	0	72	16777215	70
0	You have 4 sets of microbursts of varying lengths & wattage levels ahead of you	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
0	Set 1: 15 seconds at 145% FTP	5	0	0	72	16777215	90
0	Set 2: 30 seconds at 125% FTP	5	0	0	72	16777215	97
0	Set 3: 45 seconds at 115% FTP	5	0	0	72	16777215	104
0	Set 4: 18 seconds at 135% FTP	5	0	0	72	16777215	111
0	Each set of microbursts has 15 seconds of rest between each micro-interval	6	0	0	72	16777215	113
120	3-minute warming effort in about 30 seconds	5	0	0	72	16777215	90
120	Keep your spin quick and light...	4	0	0	72	16777215	97
120	preferably above 90rpm	4	0	0	72	16777215	102
240	3 minutes at 90% FTP...	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
240	and a cadence between 85-95rpm	5	0	0	72	16777215	7
420	3 clearing-effort bursts coming up	5	0	0	72	16777215	75
420	Use this opportunity to find your cadence	8	0	0	72	16777215	85
420	Shoot for a high cadence of 100rpm or higher if you can control it	8	0	0	72	16777215	95
420	Bring your cadence up before the interval begins & stay relaxed	8	0	0	72	16777215	105
540	6 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
546	Ease up but keep your legs quick	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
600	Lots of leg speed!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
606	Slow things back down but not too far	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
660	Quick legs!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
666	Clearly, leg speed will be a focal point of this workout	8	0	0	72	16777215	54
666	This means we'll want to focus on a couple of things:	8	0	0	72	16777215	64
666	Keeping your cadence high - shoot for at least 100rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	74
666	Also, stay seated and make one of the goals of this workout...	8	0	0	72	16777215	84
666	improved seated power & control	8	0	0	72	16777215	94
666	It's important to be able to generate big watts...	8	0	0	72	16777215	104
666	both out of the saddle AND in the saddle	8	0	0	72	16777215	114
666	Today is very much about generating big power without standing up	8	0	0	72	16777215	124
666	The first set of 15-second intervals at 145% FTP starts in about a minute	8	0	0	72	16777215	174
666	Each burst of 15 seconds at 145% FTP is followed by 15 seconds of rest...	8	0	0	72	16777215	184
666	and this sequence will repeat for about 7 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	194
666	Start bringing that cadence up	8	0	0	72	16777215	214
900	Quick legs, lots of power!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
915	Ease up but keep your legs spinning quickly	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
930	Get your legs speed all at once!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
945	Ease off the power, keep the leg speed	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
960	Again, go fast!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
975	OK, on your own for the next few repeats - stay quick & aware	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1155	Well over halfway through this set! Keep that cadence high	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1245	Only 3 microbursts left, stay tough!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1320	Last one!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
1335	One set down! Nicely done	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1335	Take some deep breaths, exhaling completely	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1335	Microbursts are hugely effective in terms of training response...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1335	because they allow you to accumulate a lot more work...	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1335	way above Threshold than you could manage in longer intervals	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
1335	So, do your best to make the most out of each of these sets	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
1335	Stay in the saddle & maintain a fast cadence...	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
1335	and always with good form - we don't want to encourage bad habits	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
1335	Be sure you're not bouncing in your saddle despite a high cadence...	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
1335	and be sure your knees are not wobbling about	8	0	0	72	16777215	90
1335	Also, avoid carrying tension in your upper body, especially your shoulders	8	0	0	72	16777215	100
1335	This might seem like a lot to focus on...	8	0	0	72	16777215	110
1335	but everything will eventually come together, quite naturally...	8	0	0	72	16777215	120
1335	if you focus on one piece of the "form puzzle" at a time	8	0	0	72	16777215	130
1335	Second set of 30-second microbursts at 125% FTP coming up in a minute	8	0	0	72	16777215	675
1335	Again, you'll have 15 seconds worth of rest between intervals...	8	0	0	72	16777215	685
1335	so keep that cadence high for the whole set because it can get ...	8	0	0	72	16777215	695
1335	even MORE taxing trying to raise your cadence over & over again	8	0	0	72	16777215	705
2070	Find a good breathing rhythm straight away...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2070	even if you don't need deep breaths just yet	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2070	Exhale fully & the rest will take care of itself	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2100	Ease up but don't lose any leg speed	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2115	Just like last time, try to get all your speed/power at once	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2115	And if you're using an electronic trainer like a KICKR or CompuTrainer...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2115	it's really important that you set your cadence BEFORE the resistance spikes	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2145	So for those on electronic trainers in Erg mode, keep your spin stable	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2160	For those riders on more traditional trainers...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2160	you too will be best off with a quick spin the whole time, but...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2160	You'll need to add a couple gears just as the interval starts & hammer!	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2190	Ease off the power but keep the legs quick	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2205	Hammer but stay completely controlled	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2235	Don't bail out of an interval unless you HAVE to...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2235	no bailing just because you WANT to ;-)	3	0	0	72	16777215	10
2250	30 seconds of focus & speed	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2250	10 more seconds, don't back off even a little!	5	0	0	72	16777215	20
2280	Is your cadence still high? Keep it there	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2325	Keep that spin up!	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
2475	Last couple bursts but ALL your focus is on this interval only	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2505	Nice, keep your legs zinging along	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2520	Last one! Keep that pretty pedaling intact	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2550	Well done! Keep those pedals turning forward for a minute if you can	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2550	Avoiding immediate backpedaling will ultimately help you recover faster	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2550	Time to enjoy some easy, steady Endurance riding	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2550	30 seconds until round 3 begins	8	0	0	72	16777215	705
2550	Find your high cadence, preferably above 100rpm...	8	0	0	72	16777215	715
2550	and maintain it for all 6 of these 45-second segments at 115% FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	725
3285	Shoot for 90+rpm for this entire set, 100+ if possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3285	Maintaining a higher cadence will shift the onus from your muscles...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3285	to your heart & lungs making your spin more aerobic	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3285	This is a more efficient way to ride in terms of sparing your muscles & sugar stores	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3285	5 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	40
3330	Excellent, same 15-second recoveries though...seems unfair ;-)	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3345	Hit it again, get your power & spin as fast as possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3345	30 more seconds, don't let your leg speed slip away	8	0	0	72	16777215	15
3345	20 seconds, don't ease up, don't tense up	8	0	0	72	16777215	25
3345	Final 10 seconds, tons of control	5	0	0	72	16777215	35
3390	Keep your legs turning quickly, no time to backpedal	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3405	45 seconds, powerful & steady	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3405	30 seconds to go, make sure your sit bones are anchored	8	0	0	72	16777215	15
3405	10 seconds, hold it steady	5	0	0	72	16777215	35
3465	If possible, slip down into a more aero position...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3465	preferably, with your hands in the drops if you can hold your power	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3465	20 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	25
3465	10 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	35
3510	Excellent! Ease up but keep spinning	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
3525	Keep all your focus on this interval only	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3525	It's seldom beneficial to allow your mind to get too far ahead...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3525	so keep it right here, right now	5	0	0	72	16777215	20
3525	15 seconds!	3	0	0	72	16777215	30

3690	Very nice! Only 1 to go, keep spinning	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3705	Last effort in the set, make it the best looking one yet	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3705	The more fluid & relaxed you ride, the less wasteful you become	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3705	So even though you're becoming more & more fatigued...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3705	There's no reason to show it by riding poorly - fluid & relaxed	8	0	0	72	16777215	30

3750	These are 18-seconds in length & will put you at 135% FTP	8	0	0	72	16777215	685
3750	You know the drill by now, keep that cadence high & steady...	8	0	0	72	16777215	695
3750	even during the short recovery valleys which aren't quite long enough...	8	0	0	72	16777215	705
3750	to allow you to backpedal more than 5 seconds at the most	8	0	0	72	16777215	715
4485	Here we go! High cadence, full belly-breaths	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
