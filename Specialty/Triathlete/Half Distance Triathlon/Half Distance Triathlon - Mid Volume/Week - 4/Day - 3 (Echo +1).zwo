            <textevent message="So rides that used to require a bit (or a lot) of food..." timeoffset="390"/>

            <textevent message="This could prove useful both in the sense that it breaks up the workout..." timeoffset="20"/>

            <textevent message="This has to do with shorter, lighter muscle contractions, but that's beside the point" timeoffset="50"/>
            <textevent message="The real point is that lighter, quicker spins can help preserve those sugar stores too!" timeoffset="60"/>

            <textevent message="you'll watch your peformance capabilities become less dependent on sugar intake" timeoffset="80"/>
            <textevent message="This is of special concern to athletes who are riding for longer than 90 minutes..." timeoffset="90"/>

            <textevent message="Riding low doesn't have to bring about a change in your pelvic position" timeoffset="310"/>
            <textevent message="With a proper aero fit &amp; good flexibility, your hip position won't change a bit" timeoffset="320"/>
            <textevent message="The second thing to monitor is your hip ANGLE, or how close your body gets to your thighs" timeoffset="330"/>
            <textevent message="Flat back riders have a tendency to almost fold their torsos onto their quads" timeoffset="340"/>

            <textevent message="One way to reduce this angle is to round your low back a bit more" timeoffset="370"/>
            <textevent message="By almost &quot;carving&quot; out a breathing space for your belly, your hip angle opens a little" timeoffset="380"/>
            <textevent message="not to mention you create more room to breathe with your belly" timeoffset="390"/>
