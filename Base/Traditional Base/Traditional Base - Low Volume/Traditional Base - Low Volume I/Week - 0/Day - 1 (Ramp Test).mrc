DESCRIPTION = The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can’t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you’re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it’s important to give it everything you’ve got.The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there’s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you’re finished; click “End Test” and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.Tips and Hints:- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results.&nbsp;- For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you’re fueled, motivated, and well rested.- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training.&nbsp;- Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there’s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.-If you’re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position.

0	This alternate testing protocol...	3	0	0	72	16777215	19
0	is aimed at offering an alternative to longer, steady-state efforts...	5	0	0	72	16777215	23
0	like the 8- or 20-minute tests	3	0	0	72	16777215	29
0	This alternative is ideal for new riders...	4	0	0	72	16777215	34
0	who may not be familiar with pacing those steady efforts...	5	0	0	72	16777215	39
0	but it can work just as well...	3	0	0	72	16777215	45
0	for even the most experienced cyclists	4	0	0	72	16777215	49
0	Your goal for this test...	3	0	0	72	16777215	56
0	is to pedal until you physically can't continue pedalling anymore	5	0	0	72	16777215	60
0	What lays ahead is a series of 1-minute steps...	4	0	0	72	16777215	67
0	that will start somewhere very close to 50% of your current FTP...	5	0	0	72	16777215	72
0	or roughly half of what you've estimated your FTP to be	5	0	0	72	16777215	78
0	This will feel easy at first...	3	0	0	72	16777215	85
0	and might feel easy for awhile...	5	0	0	72	16777215	90
0	But eventually, it gets really hard	3	0	0	72	16777215	96
0	Once the effort feels very difficult...	3	0	0	72	16777215	101
0	you'll only have a handful of minutes left	4	0	0	72	16777215	105
0	Remember...	3	0	0	72	16777215	111
0	this is a test to see how far you can push yourself	3	0	0	72	16777215	115
0	That means you'll need to go all out...	4	0	0	72	16777215	120
0	but you've got this!	4	0	0	72	16777215	125
0	Giving your all is important...	4	0	0	72	16777215	130
0	so your future workouts are adjusted to your abilities	5	0	0	72	16777215	135
0	So before you get started, let's check on a few things...	4	0	0	72	16777215	142
0	if you have a fan, turn it on high	5	0	0	72	16777215	147
0	and grab everything you need to go deep	5	0	0	72	16777215	153
0	Because this is a Ramp Test...	3	0	0	72	16777215	160
0	there will be no recovery between now...	4	0	0	72	16777215	164
0	and when it's too hard to keep going	4	0	0	72	16777215	169
0	Only two more minutes until you start ramping	4	0	0	72	16777215	180
0	One thing that really helps...	3	0	0	72	16777215	185
0	is to remember that even though this is a test to failure...	5	0	0	72	16777215	190
0	it's only hard for a few minutes	4	0	0	72	16777215	197
0	And you know you can do anything for just a few minutes!	4	0	0	72	16777215	202
0	Once you've done all that you can...	3	0	0	72	16777215	216
0	You'll receive an estimate of your FTP...	5	0	0	72	16777215	221
0	which is the benchmark we use to adjust your training	4	0	0	72	16777215	227
0	Just one more minute before the ramping begins...	4	0	0	72	16777215	240
0	take a deep breath and focus on your goals...	3	0	0	72	16777215	245
0	This is your first step in achieving those goals...	4	0	0	72	16777215	249
0	So, no matter the result, you're well on your way	4	0	0	72	16777215	255
0	You've got this!	4	0	0	72	16777215	293
300	And here we go	4	0	0	72	16777215	0
300	A few things worth noting...	5	0	0	72	16777215	7
300	1 - Try to remain seated throughout the entirety of the ramp test	5	0	0	72	16777215	14
300	Standing and "sprinting to the line" will adversely affect our estimate...	5	0	0	72	16777215	21
300	and standing earlier in the workout can also cloud the estimation waters	5	0	0	72	16777215	27
300	So stay in the saddle	3	0	0	72	16777215	34
300	2 - If you're on a smart trainer...	4	0	0	72	16777215	40
300	you have the luxury of options	4	0	0	72	16777215	45
300	You can either use Erg or Resistance mode...	4	0	0	72	16777215	51
300	whichever suits you	3	0	0	72	16777215	56
360	Next step, stay smooth...	4	0	0	72	16777215	0
360	and just as relaxed as you've been all along	4	0	0	72	16777215	5
360	Again, it's likely to take a bit of time...	5	0	0	72	16777215	11
360	before this starts to feel like work	4	0	0	72	16777215	17
360	Some riders will start to hurt only several minutes in...	5	0	0	72	16777215	23
360	while others will take a bit longer...	5	0	0	72	16777215	29
420	Next small bump in effort...	4	0	0	72	16777215	0
420	but no real changes anywhere...	4	0	0	72	16777215	5
420	smooth, relaxed, steady cadence	4	0	0	72	16777215	10
420	By now you've gleaned that a ramp test is just that...	5	0	0	72	16777215	16
420	a ramp used to test (assess) your fitness	5	0	0	72	16777215	22
420	In this case, we're trying to estimate your max steady-state power...	5	0	0	72	16777215	29
420	based on just how far you can push yourself up this ramp	5	0	0	72	16777215	35
480	One more step...	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
480	You're still doing great!	5	0	0	72	16777215	7
540	Up again...	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
540	You are in control of your breathing...	5	0	0	72	16777215	5
540	So relax, drop your shoulders, easy in, easy out.	5	0	0	72	16777215	10
600	Step it up!	4	0	0	72	16777215	0
600	And make that pedal stroke smooth	4	0	0	72	16777215	5
600	because smooth equals fast :)	4	0	0	72	16777215	10
660	Another step	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
660	That's one step closer to your goal	5	0	0	72	16777215	5
660	maybe this is still a breeze...	3	0	0	72	16777215	10
660	but when you tick over that one step...	4	0	0	72	16777215	14
660	and notice the fatigue for the first time...	4	0	0	72	16777215	19
660	your focus has to sharpen	3	0	0	72	16777215	24
720	With each small increase...	3	0	0	72	16777215	0
720	you can expect a slight delay...	3	0	0	72	16777215	4
720	in the pending rise in discomfort	3	0	0	72	16777215	8
720	It might take 10-20 seconds...	3	0	0	72	16777215	13
720	but it's coming, so be ready for it	4	0	0	72	16777215	17
720	Stay on top of your cadence...	4	0	0	72	16777215	23
720	and stay focused	4	0	0	72	16777215	28
780	Here we go	4	0	0	72	16777215	0
780	by now your breathing may be getting faster	4	0	0	72	16777215	5
780	and your legs might be feeling it too	3	0	0	72	16777215	11
780	Smooth and strong, you've got this!	4	0	0	72	16777215	15
