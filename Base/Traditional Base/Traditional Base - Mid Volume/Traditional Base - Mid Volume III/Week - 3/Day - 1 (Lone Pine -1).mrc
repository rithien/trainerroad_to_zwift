[COURSE TEXT]
0	Welcome to Lone Pine -1!	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
0	Today's workout consists of 5x10-minute intervals within the Threshold power range	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
0	In other words, each interval will put you between 95-99% of FTP...	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
0	and you'll have 3 minutes of recovery between intervals	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
0	Today's main goal is twofold:	5	0	0	72	16777215	50
0	First, we'll be working to improve FTP...	5	0	0	72	16777215	57
0	but doing so while spending more & more time in the aero position	8	0	0	72	16777215	65
0	So first & foremost, raise sustainable power; secondly, do it while aero	8	0	0	72	16777215	75
0	For now, just focus on continuing your warm-up	8	0	0	72	16777215	85
120	We'll take a couple minutes to clear the legs in about 30 seconds	8	0	0	72	16777215	90
120	Utilize the cadence you plan to apply to today's intervals...	8	0	0	72	16777215	100
120	ideally this will hover between 85-95rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	110
240	Bring up your cadence and sit tall so you can breathe well	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
360	Spending time so close to your FTP will improve your sustainable power...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
360	as well as muscle endurance by teaching your muscles to deal...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
360	with high levels of lactate & acidic buildup without letting off the gas	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
360	Along with these physical adaptations come mental improvements as well	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
360	This type of work will help you learn to mentally tolerate the discomfort...	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
360	that comes with working at high levels of your FTP for extended periods	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
360	And today, we'll be adding yet another layer to all of this	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
360	Being able to output high levels of power for extended periods of time is important...	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
360	but so is being able to do so in your most aerodynamic way possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
360	In other words, the more aerodynamic you can make yourself...	8	0	0	72	16777215	90
360	the better spent your energy will be	5	0	0	72	16777215	100
360	We'll use today as an opportunity to explore your aero position's limits	8	0	0	72	16777215	110
360	You still have a couple more minutes until the first interval begins...	8	0	0	72	16777215	120
360	so let's talk a bit about your aero form	8	0	0	72	16777215	130
360	If you're on a normal road bike, your aero position will be in the handlebar drops	8	0	0	72	16777215	140
360	The aero position is a bit more self-explanatory if you're using a TT or Tri bike	8	0	0	72	16777215	150
360	First, start by focusing on your placement on the saddle	8	0	0	72	16777215	160
360	Make sure your weight is evenly distributed on both sit bones...	8	0	0	72	16777215	170
360	and that your sit-bones are planted firmly on the wings of your saddle	8	0	0	72	16777215	180
360	If you find it impossible to keep both sit bones anchored to the saddle while in your aero position...	8	0	0	72	16777215	190
360	it's likely your flexibility and/or bike fit may need attention	8	0	0	72	16777215	200
360	If flexibility is an issue, it can usually be addressed with consistent stretching	8	0	0	72	16777215	210
360	If it's a fit issue, your best bet is consulting a bike fit expert	8	0	0	72	16777215	220
360	Plan to get aero on the 10-minute mark	5	0	0	72	16777215	230
600	Here we go! Spend as much of this first 2 minutes aero if you feel warm enough	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
600	If need be, you may rise out of the aero position for a break...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
600	if your form starts to fall apart or your watts/cadence begin to falter	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
600	If/when you rise for an upright break, try to limit your breaks to 10-30 seconds	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
720	Good job! Sit up for the next 2 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
720	Ride tall & make the most of your breathing by using your belly	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
840	Ok, time to get aero again for as much as 2 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
840	Don't worry if you're unable to hold the aero position for the entire 2 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
840	Even if you're an otherwise powerful rider...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
840	an aero position is something that takes time to become accustomed to	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
840	Make sure you're drawing full breaths	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
840	Some say a good approach is to focus on a complete exhale...	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
840	and the rest of the breathing pattern will take care of itself	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
840	Less than a minute more of aero work	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
960	And back into an upright position for the next 2 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1080	Final 2 minutes, let's get aero again if you can hold your power & cadence steady	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1200	Nicely done! 3 minutes to take things easy	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1380	Round 2, get aero for another 2 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1380	Once again, make sure those sit bones are "glued" to your saddle wings	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1380	If you find this difficult or even impossible...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1380	a new bike fit or some minor tweaks may be worth considering	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1380	That is, if regular hamstring & lower back stretching doesn't do the trick	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
1500	2 minutes down! Move into an upright position	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1620	Time to get aero again	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1620	Try to "relax" into the aero position as soon as possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
1620	Obviously, the word "relaxed" doesn't correlate with hard efforts...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
1620	but you don't want to carry any tension in your upper body	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
1620	In other words, avoid a rigid upper body...	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
1620	and you're far more likely to avoid wasting energy	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
1620	So do your best to find this "effortless" riding style	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
1740	Out of the aero position for 2 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1860	Final 2-minute push! Get aero if you can	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
1980	Ease up for 3 minutes	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
1980	Following a hard interval, do your best to wait at least 30 seconds to backpedal	5	0	0	72	16777215	7
1980	This will ultimately help you clear your legs faster	5	0	0	72	16777215	14
1980	Round 3 coming up, find that aero position	5	0	0	72	16777215	170
2160	Smooth pedalstroke, relaxed upper body, 2 minutes	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2160	Try to stay aero for another minute...	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
2160	but make sure you sit up to regain proper form, cadence and/or power	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
2160	If your watts/cadence drop drastically or your form fails...	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
2160	these brief, upright breaks are usually all you'll require	8	0	0	72	16777215	90
2280	Good job! Go ahead and sit up	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2400	Find that aero position once again, and as you ease down into it...	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2400	make sure you aren't affecting your ability to draw full breaths	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2520	And back up!	5	0	0	72	16777215	0
2520	Ride tall & keep your power as steady as possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	7
2640	Final 2 aero minutes in the interval!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2640	Make sure you're not tightening those shoulders	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2640	Tuck your head in, but make sure you're gaze is still ahead	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2640	Your indoor, aero position should be the same as your outdoor one	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
2640	And it's our hope that you're looking ahead when riding outdoors ;-)	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
2640	So reinforce the good (necessary) habits you implement outdoors...	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
2640	when you're riding with us indoors	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
2640	Less than a minute to go! Stay tough & keep good form	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
2760	Great work! Enjoy a well deserved 3 minutes of rest	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2940	And we're off once again, find that aero position	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
2940	Rather than 2-minute increments of aero work...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
2940	see how long you can remain in an aero position for the final 3 intervals	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
2940	Of course, only stay aero as long as your watts & form are on point	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
2940	Sit up for 10-30 seconds as needed	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
2940	Also, do your best to keep a steady cadence between 85-95rpm...	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
2940	but you may drop a bit outside that range as fatigue grows	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
2940	That said, set a cadence floor of 80rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
2940	In other words, sit up or reduce the watts by 3-5%...	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
2940	if you're unable to maintain a cadence of at least 80rpm	8	0	0	72	16777215	90
3060	Still aero? Still keeping your power on Target?	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3060	Upright or down low, try to limit how far your power fluctuates	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3060	As riders spend more time on their invaluable in under appreciated trainers...	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3060	it's common to see their power become smoother over time	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3060	This happens even more quickly if you spend a couple minutes here & there...	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
3060	trying to limit how far above & below you roam from your Target Power	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
3240	We're well into the latter half of this interval	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3240	Are you periodically checking on your form?	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
3240	Make sure you FEEL those sit bones on the wide part of your saddle	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
3240	Be sure your upper body is relaxed...	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
3240	and make sure your pedalstroke is effective with steady pressure throughout	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
3240	Do your best to not drop your heels on the bottom of the pedalstroke...	8	0	0	72	16777215	80
3240	unless that extra calf stretch works well for you	8	0	0	72	16777215	90
3240	Oh, and be sure your knees aren't wobbling about...	8	0	0	72	16777215	100
3240	especially at the top of each pedalstroke	8	0	0	72	16777215	110
3360	Quick form check, be aware of how well you're riding	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3480	Final minute! Try to spend it aero	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3540	Excellent, another quick break with a light spin	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3720	Here we go! Final interval of the workout	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3780	Keep limiting your non-aero breaks to 30 seconds if possible	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3960	As the fatigue grows, make sure your form is still on point	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
3960	It's easy to get sloppy when you're feeling gassed...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
3960	but staying focused & aware can help prevent this	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
3960	Focus on appearing relaxed & comfortable on your bike	8	0	0	72	16777215	30
3960	Tensing up will only serve to expend needless energy...	8	0	0	72	16777215	40
3960	and force you to work against the bike rather than with it	8	0	0	72	16777215	50
4080	Another slight shift in effort to keep you focused on the work	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4200	You have 2 minutes of work left, that's all!	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4200	No matter how much you're hurting, try to keep that aero position...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
4200	along with your cadence & Target Power	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
4320	Very well done! That's it for this one	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
4320	Time to start thinking post-workout nutrition (or eating it)...	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
4320	and we'll see you next time!	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
