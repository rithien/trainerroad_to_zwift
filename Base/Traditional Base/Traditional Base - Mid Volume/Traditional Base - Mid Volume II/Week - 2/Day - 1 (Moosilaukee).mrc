780	Use this 30 seconds to lower your cadence	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
780	The goal is 50-60rpm but this depends on your knee health	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
780	It also depends on how well you can hold Target Power	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
810	If you can't steady your watts, spin slightly quicker	8	0	0	72	16777215	0
810	These drills are all about muscle control & joint integrity	8	0	0	72	16777215	10
810	So watch your knees and try to eliminate ANY wobble	8	0	0	72	16777215	20
810	Slow spins are great for seeing how well you pedal	8	0	0	72	16777215	30

2160	Your hands belong in the drops and your body will be low	8	0	0	72	16777215	60
2160	The idea is to generate a LOT of force & use a LOT of muscle	8	0	0	72	16777215	70
