            <textevent message="The second thing to monitor is your hip ANGLE, or how close your body gets to your thighs" timeoffset="330.000000"/>
            <textevent message="Flat back riders have a tendency to almost fold their torsos onto their quads" timeoffset="340.000000"/>
            <textevent message="This creates a very sharp angle at your hips and can even restrict blood flow to your legs" timeoffset="350.000000"/>
            <textevent message="But if you can open this angle up even a little, the difference in power can be surprising" timeoffset="360.000000"/>
            <textevent message="One way to reduce this angle is to round your low back a bit more..." timeoffset="370.000000"/>
            <textevent message="and almost 'carve out' a breathing space for your belly" timeoffset="380.000000"/>

        <SteadyState Duration="390.0" PowerLow="0.800" PowerHigh="0.800">
            <textevent message="Over the remaining minutes of this segment, feel free to dedicate some of your attention..." timeoffset="30.000000"/>
            <textevent message="to some cadence modifications: a few minutes at your 'natural' cadence..." timeoffset="40.000000"/>
            <textevent message="a few spent slightly below it, and a few slightly above it" timeoffset="50.000000"/>

            <textevent message="As you do this, make sure to adjust your breathing accordingly" timeoffset="410.000000"/>
            <textevent message="A quicker, more aerobic spin requires more muscle contractions, more oxygen, more breaths per minute" timeoffset="420.000000"/>
            <textevent message="But at no point should you verge on panting, not at this effort level..." timeoffset="430.000000"/>
